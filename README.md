## Useful crates

I've found uses for these crates in prior years, so noting them here for reference:

- anyhow
- indoc
- `strum = { version = "0.26", features = ["derive"] }`
- regex
- priority-queue
- nom
- arrayvec
- itertools
- nalgebra
- ndarray
- rustc-hash
- rayon
- gcd - greatest common divisor
- lazy_static - although this is no longer needed
